# Test Azure Subscription
Populates a test azure subscription with some a: 
 * core-infra and containers resource group
 * Some demo Linux container instances
 * An Automation Account
 * A few Windows VMâ€™s
 * A KeyVault
 * A simple Virtual Network

Hopefully you also configured usage and budget alerts so you don't use up all of your credits!

It also includes an excel file that can be used to create a bunch of test or fake Azure AD users using the "Bulk Upload" feature in the portal.
